What is this?
=============

The root-container-test-subprojectA is part of the root-container-test project.
It is a nice playground to see how the [root-container project](https://github.com/moufmouf/root-container) behaves.

This subproject is simply declaring a DI container with 2 entries: 'a' and 'c'.
"root-container-test-subprojectB" declares another entry 'b'.

If you do not know the [root-container project](https://github.com/moufmouf/root-container), you should start by
reading about it on the project's page.
